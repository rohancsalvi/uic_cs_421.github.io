# Grading Policies  

## Gradescope Assignments  
There will be **4 assignments** containing a mix of theoretical and coding questions.  

- **Coding Component** (Python):  
  - **80%** — Program functionality (implementation, model building, evaluation on metrics)  
  - **20%** — Code quality (clean, well-written, well-designed)  

- **Written Component**:  
  - **70%** — Accuracy of content  
  - **30%** — Clarity of explanation  

---

## Projects  
- Goal: Design and implement a simple NLP system using existing tools. More details will be shared later. 
- Work is **done in pairs** (two undergrads or two grads, no mixed pairs).  

---

## Research Study *(Graduate Students Only)*  
Graduate students (and interested undergraduates) will conduct a **research reproducibility project** due the week before finals.  
- Can be done individually or in pairs.  
- If paired: submission must include a signed statement describing each student’s contribution.  

**Breakdown:**  
- **10%** — Presentation  
- **20%** — Report  
- **10%** — Source code

## Evaluation Principles  
- Your grade is based on the **points you earn**, not on comparison with other students.  
- There are **no quotas** for letter grades.  
- Assessment is designed to be comprehensive, fair, and equitable.

## Point Breakdown  

### Undergraduate Students  
- **Assignments:** 50% (12.5% each)  
- **Project:** 50% (25% each deliverable)  

### Graduate Students  
- **Assignments:** 40% (10% each)  
- **Project:** 20% (10% each deliverable)  
- **Research Study:** 40% (10% presentation, 20% report, 10% code)

## Letter Grades  

| Overall Score (Undergrad) | Overall Score (Graduate) | Letter Grade |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| 88%                       | 92%                       | A            |
| 78%                       | 82%                       | B            |

## Regrading Policy  
- Requests must be made **within one week** of the assignment being returned.  
- **Arithmetic errors:** Attach a note explaining the mistake → points corrected before semester ends.  
- **Other grading concerns:**  
  - Write a short note explaining why you believe more points should be awarded.  
  - Attach it to the front of your assignment and give it to your TA.  
  - Keep a photocopy for your records.  
  - These requests will be reviewed **at the end of the semester** after final grades are calculated.
